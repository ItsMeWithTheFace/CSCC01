# Individual Assignment 1

## Github repositories

It is recommended to get a local copy of the following three Github repositories: 

- **the CSCC01 course repository** (public repo - read only)

    In this repository you will find the course materials and starter code for the different deliverables. To clone this repository:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ThierrySans/CSCC01
    ```

- **your personal repository** (accessible by you and the course staff) 
    
    In this repository, you will push the solution for your individual assignments. To clone this repository:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/CSCC01F17/__your_email_preffix__
    ```
    
    if your email is john.doe@utoronto.ca, the __your_email_preffix__ should be john.doe


- **your team repository** (accessible by you, your team members and the course staff)
    
    In this repository, you will push your project deliverables. To clone this repository:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/CSCC01F17/__team__id__
    ```

## Instructions

1.1 If you have not done so yet, clone the course repository and your personal repository. In your personal repository, copy the starter code (`/work/01/src/MergeSort.java`) from the course repository into yours (`/01/src/MergeSort.java`).  

1.2 Test this file and fix the bugs

1.3 Commit the bug fix, with an appropriate commit message. Push.

# Individual Assignment 2

In this assignment, make sure to adopt the best practices for creating development branches and merging these development branches into the master branch as seen in class/lab. 

1. if you have not done so yet, clone the course repository and your personal repository. In your personal repository, copy the starter code (`/work/05/src/turtle.py`) from the course repository into yours (`/02/src/turtle.java`). Before starting to work, look up the reference to 
["turtles all the way down!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down). 

2. create a branch called `bugfix`, test this file and fix the bugs.

3. commit the changes to that branch only.

4. after realizing that the code does not work in Python3, create a branch called `python3` from the `master` branch, and modify the original file `turtle.py` on that new branch so that it works with Python3.

5. commit the changes to the branch only. 

6. merge the `bugfix` branch into the master branch. 

7. merge the `python3` branch into the master branch.

6. push all changes to Github.
